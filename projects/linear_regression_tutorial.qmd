### Purpose

Linear regression is an essential tool for any statistician, data scientist, or machine learning practitioner. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression can be used:

* to make future predictions based on historical data
* to understand the strength of relationships between variables
* to identify trends in data 

This tutorial will cover the basics of linear regression using Python. To demonstrate, a database containing housing prices in California and the resident's income will be used. The goal of this tutorial is to predict the price of a house based on the resident's income.

### Prepping the Data
##### Import Necessary Libraries
The libraries being used are *pandas*, *matplotlib*, and *sklearn*. *Pandas* is a useful library for creating dataframes and analysis. *Matplotlib* is used for creating data visualizations.*Sklearn* contains the dataset we will be using for this tutorial.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
```
Ensure the following libraries are installed in your Python environment by using the command `pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn` in your terminal.

##### Load the Dataset
Sklearn datasets are normally in a NumPy arrays format. To make it easier to work with, we will convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. We will do this using the following code:
```{python}
df = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True).frame
```
`as_frame = True` combined with `.frame` allows us to easily convert the NumPy array into a pandas DataFrame. Each row in this dataset represents one district in California. This dataset contains 9 columns `MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude, MedHouseVal`. For this tutorial we will be using **MedInc** (the median income for California districts) to predict **MedHouseVal** (the median house value for California districts). To isolate these two columns, we can use the following code:
```{python}
x = df[["MedInc"]]    # Will be mapped on the x-axis(independent variable)
y = df["MedHouseVal"]   # Will be mapped on the y-axis(dependent variable)
```
### Exploratory Data Analysis
Before we can build a linear regression model, it is important to check if a linear model would be appropriate to model the relationship between the two variables. To do this, we can create a scatter plot of the data using the following code:
```{python}
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.xlabel("Median Income")
plt.ylabel("Median House Value")
plt.title("Scatter Plot of Average Number of Rooms vs. Median House Value")
plt.show()
```
