### Purpose

Linear regression is an essential tool for any statistician, data scientist, or machine learning practitioner. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression can be used:
- to make future predictions 
- understand the strength of relationships between variables
- identify trends in data. 
This tutorial will cover the basics of linear regression using Python. To demonstrate, a database containing pricing and size (in square feet) of houses in California will be used. The goal of this tutorial is to predict the price of a house based on its size.

### Import necessary libraries
```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
```

The libraries being used are pandas and sklearn. *Pandas* is a useful library for data modeling and analysis. *Sklearn* contains the dataset we will be using for this tutorial.
