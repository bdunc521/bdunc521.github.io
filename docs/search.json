    "text": "Purpose\nLinear regression is an essential tool for any statistician, data scientist, or machine learning practitioner. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression can be used:\n\nto make future predictions based on historical data\nto understand the strength of relationships between variables\nto identify trends in data\n\nThis tutorial will cover the basics of linear regression using Python. To demonstrate, a database containing housing prices in California and the resident’s income will be used. The goal of this tutorial is to predict the price of a house based on the resident’s income.\n\n\nPrepping the Data\n\nImport Necessary Libraries\nThe libraries being used are pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn. Pandas is a useful library for creating dataframes and analysis. Matplotlib is used for creating data visualizations.Sklearn contains the dataset we will be using for this tutorial.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nEnsure the following libraries are installed in your Python environment by using the command pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn in your terminal.\n\n\nLoad the Dataset\nSklearn datasets are normally in a NumPy arrays format. To make it easier to work with, we will convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. We will do this using the following code:\ndf = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True).frame\nas_frame = True combined with .frame allows us to easily convert the NumPy array into a pandas DataFrame. Each row in this dataset represents one district in California. This dataset contains 9 columns MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude, MedHouseVal. For this tutorial we will be using MedInc (the median income for California districts) to predict MedHouseVal (the median house value for California districts). To isolate these two columns, we can use the following code:\nx = df[[\"AveRooms\"]]    # Will be mapped on the x-axis(independent variable)\ny = df[\"MedHouseVal\"]   # Will be mapped on the y-axis(dependent variable)\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nBefore we can build a linear regression model, it is important to check if a linear model would be appropriate to model the relationship between the two variables. To do this, we can create a scatter plot of the data using the following code: {python plt.scatter(x, y) plt.xlabel(\"Average Number of Rooms per Household\") plt.ylabel(\"Median House Value\") plt.title(\"Scatter Plot of Average Number of Rooms vs. Median House Value\") plt.show()",
